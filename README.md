# DevAdopts

## Description
DevAdopts is a React-based web application that allows users in the UK to search for adoptable dogs based on their preferences. Whether you're looking for a high-energy companion or a dog suited for a small garden, DevAdopts helps you find the perfect match.

Users can interact with a chatbot to specify their requirements, browse dogs, and save their favorites. Additional features include viewing detailed dog profiles, a donation page, and user account management. 

You can access the website directly via our deployed frontend on Render [here](https://devadopts-frontend.onrender.com/).
